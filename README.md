<h1>Flappy Bird (2D)</h1>
<p>Flappy Bird is a 2013 casual game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen (Vietnamese: Nguyễn Hà Đông), under his game development company .Gears.[1] The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The player's score is determined by the number of pipes they pass. Nguyen created the game over a period of several days, using the bird from a cancelled game made in 2012.</p>
